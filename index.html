  <p>A highly experienced senior contract administrator, I have depth of experience pre and post contract and a track record of high
    performance working for contractors and client-side on major public sector projects. I have worked on projects full-lifecycle, as
    a procurement manager pre-contract and contracts manager through the delivery lifecycle.</p>
  <p>Strategic, methodical and detail-focused, I bring the demonstrated ability to mitigate commercial risks, resolve problems and
    optimise outcomes. I have developed improved management systems, increased margins and cash flow and successfully
    resolved complex disputes.</p>
  <p>I started my career in project management and understand the delivery process and site construction which has enhanced my
    ability to achieve excellent commercial results. My contractual and technical knowledge is complemented with strong
    communication and negotiation skills. I establish and manage strong stakeholder relationships and ensure that there is
    collaboration between delivery partners and internal stakeholders.</p>
